## Introduction
Food is essential to human life and is a very big part of peoples cultures. Not only does it provide
basic sustencance like energy and nutrients, but it is often at the center of celebrations,festivals, 
and gatherings fostering a sense of community and value. With the vast amount of recipes out there,it is important to understand certian factors such as cook time, ingrediants and steps to allow others to replicate the meal. Through the rise of cooking channels and online platforms to share recipies, many have begun to rate the recipes that they have tried to cook based of different factors includng cook time. **With this in mind we want to understand the relationship between cooking time and average rating of recipes**. We want to explore if differnet cook times that are considered 'low' or 'high' have different average ratings. In order to do this we analyzed two datasets, one ratings and the other recipes. These were found on https://food.com/ and consist of recipes that have been posted since 2008.
